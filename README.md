### Fannie Mae's Predictive Analysis and Alternative Strategies Assessment for Mitigating the 2008 Financial Crisis

#### Business Case:
Fannie Mae, a government-backed enterprise, plays a pivotal role in providing access to U.S. mortgage financing with a mission to enhance housing affordability and accessibility for Americans. A significant challenge for Fannie Mae is managing credit risk and the threat of loan defaults. Defaults can severely impact Fannie Mae’s financial stability and its ability to support qualified borrowers. To address this challenge, our project focuses on developing a predictive model using machine learning techniques to forecast loan defaults. By identifying high-risk borrowers, Fannie Mae can proactively manage credit risk, make informed lending decisions, and sustainably provide affordable mortgages.

#### Project Details:
- **Objective:** Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to default on their loans.
- **Data Used:** Historical data from Fannie Mae encompassing loan details such as interest rate, amount, duration, origination date, borrower’s credit score, property type, and more.
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tableau
- **Outcome:** Enhance Fannie Mae's financial performance by reducing exposure to credit risk and supporting strategic decision-making in lending practices.

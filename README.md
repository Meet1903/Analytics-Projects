# Analytics Projects Showcase
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing various analytics projects I've worked on. This repository serves as a portfolio where you can find detailed descriptions and links to Medium posts for each project. Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving using Python and other relevant tools.

Explore the projects below to see how I've applied analytics techniques to real-world datasets, providing insights and solutions to complex problems.

## Projects

### Fannie Mae's Predictive Analysis and Alternative Strategies Assessment for Mitigating the 2008 Financial Crisis

#### Business Case:
Fannie Mae, a government-backed enterprise, plays a pivotal role in providing access to U.S. mortgage financing with a mission to enhance housing affordability and accessibility for Americans. A significant challenge for Fannie Mae is managing credit risk and the threat of loan defaults. Defaults can severely impact Fannie Mae’s financial stability and its ability to support qualified borrowers. To address this challenge, our project focuses on developing a predictive model using machine learning techniques to forecast loan defaults. By identifying high-risk borrowers, Fannie Mae can proactively manage credit risk, make informed lending decisions, and sustainably provide affordable mortgages.

#### Project Details:
- **Objective:** Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to default on their loans.
- **Data Used:** Historical data from Fannie Mae encompassing loan details such as interest rate, amount, duration, origination date, borrower’s credit score, property type, and more.
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tableau
- **Outcome:** Enhance Fannie Mae's financial performance by reducing exposure to credit risk and supporting strategic decision-making in lending practices.

### Telecommunications Customer Churn Forecasting and Analytical Modeling

#### Business Case:
Telecommunication companies aim to increase customer satisfaction and retention by predicting customer churn rates. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers switch to a different service provider, is influenced by factors like service quality and plan competitiveness. This project focuses on developing a churn prediction model to identify at-risk customers, enabling proactive retention strategies.

#### Project Details:
- **Objective:** Develop a churn prediction model using historical telecom customer data.
- **Data Used:** Dataset includes 4250 customer records with features such as daily call minutes, number of calls, plan details, etc.
- **Models Trained:** Decision Tree classifier, Logistic regression, Boosted Trees classifier, Random forest classifier.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure compliance with data protection laws and ethical usage of customer data in incentive planning.

### Whom to Sell a Personal Loan?

#### Business Case:
In a competitive lending market, identifying potential customers who are likely to accept a personal loan offer is crucial for optimizing sales efforts and resources. This project utilizes predictive analytics on the Universal Bank dataset, which includes customer data such as educational background, income, family size, years of experience, and mortgage values. A Logistic Regression model is employed to predict whether a customer is likely to accept a personal loan offer.

#### Project Details:
- **Objective:** Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.
- **Data Used:** Universal Bank dataset containing customer attributes and loan acceptance labels.
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression.
- **Outcome:** Enable targeted marketing strategies and improve conversion rates for personal loan offers.

### Employee Attrition Insights: Leveraging IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Data

#### Business Case:
Employee attrition poses significant challenges for organizations, impacting financial resources, morale, and productivity. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify employees at risk of attrition using IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data. By analyzing demographic and job-related factors such as job satisfaction, working hours, overtime, hourly rate, and job level, we aim to predict attrition and enable proactive retention strategies. This model supports Human Resources in addressing issues like work culture, management practices, and work-life balance, thereby reducing turnover costs and fostering a more productive workforce.

#### Project Details:
- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model to identify employees likely to attrite.
- **Data Used:** [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) from Kaggle.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
- **Outcome:** Enable HR departments to implement targeted interventions such as increased pay rates and flexible work hours to mitigate attrition risks.
